# Ktisis

This is my attempt at creating an internal posing tool that allows for actor and bone manipulation.

#### List of target features, ascending:
- [x] Skeleton overlay
- [ ] Bone manipulation via overlay
- [ ] Actor list with dropdowns for bone selection
- [ ] Free camera movement within GPose

#### Features to explore, not currently in scope:
- Timeline editor for rudimentary animation
- Creation of additional actors and editing
- Placement and rendering of 3D props in-game

## Disclaimers

Ktisis can currently be considered in an early 'Alpha' state with research and development still ongoing.
<br/>
Features will be rolled out slowly, and bugs or crashes may be present.

It is not intended to be a replacement for CMTool or Anamnesis.
<br/>
My focus is not on recreating the functionality of either, so it will likely best be used in conjunction.
