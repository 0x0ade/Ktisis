This is my attempt at creating a scene editing tool that allows for actor and bone manipulation.

If you would like to reach out about this project, please feel free to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kUG3W8B8Ny) or message me at chirp#1337.

To see a list of target features as well as their current progress on implementation, see our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/w64GYAWJ/ktisis-plugin) board.

## Disclaimers

Ktisis can currently be considered in an early 'Alpha' state with research and development still ongoing.
<br/>
Features will be rolled out slowly, and bugs or crashes may be present.

It is not intended to be a replacement for CMTool or Anamnesis.
<br/>
My focus is not on recreating the functionality of either, so it will likely best be used in conjunction.
